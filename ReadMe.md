# Java Drawing Game

A GUI based project that gives you a random phrase to practice your drawing skills! (still a work in progress!)

## Background Story
I joke around that this project was my redemption arc! In college for my first java project we were given the option to pick from three GUI based assignments. A calculator, a sliding number matching game and a Microsoft paint clone. I told my professor I would do the paint clone but had difficulties in accomplishing it and wound up doing the calculator. After attending this bootcamp I finally decided to pick it up again and finish where I left off! 
## Code Description
This program consists of a JFrame which enables the user to draw, change the color of their brush, erase, drag shapes, get their drawing prompt and save their drawing.
